#Disney GifTastic!

Giphy API
Disney GifTastic -
I created an Fun App full of gifs using the Giphy API!!!

I made an array of topics(characters) and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 Disney character images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
You can add a new action from the form on the right underneath the current buttons! The characters will be added to the array of characters and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.

Resources I used:
*HTML
*JavaScript
*JQuery
*Giphy API
*CSS
*AJAX
*Bootsrap
*Google API
*Flaticon.com
